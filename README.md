# Tripity  
We have chosen the Sustainability Track. We would like to develop an application called Tripity that provides incentives for people who use public transport. The users can gain points for every bus/train ride and redeem the points for coupons and vouchers from companies who have tied up with Tripity. People travelling can make use of the mobile app to scan QR codes that are present on the buses and trains. For each ride they are provided with reward points. On scanning a QR code, sometimes the app displays a bonus question to the user based on transport routes. If answered correctly, The companies can make use of the webapp to tie up with Tripity and update the coupons and rewards information.
